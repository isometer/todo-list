This is a simple Todo List application in React.

Its purpose is twofold: 
* first, so I can learn to use React in a controlled environment.
* second, so I can use a todo list that is more robust and expansive than the one I currently keep on paper. 

start backend: cd server && node index.js
start frontend: cd client && node App.js
